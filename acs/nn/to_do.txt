0. separate accuracy from forward pass (during forward pass, it is not necessary that you are given ground truth and can compute accuracy)
1. save model in models folder and not in code folder!
2. command line args for epochs, batch_size, optimizer, lr, neurons in each hidden layer, act in each hidden layer etc
3. train.py, test.py - create files instead of separate methods in one class
4. tf.Constant
5. use previously computed pred for loss, previously computed loss for optimizer
