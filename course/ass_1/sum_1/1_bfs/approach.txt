1. Given an n x n grid with (n^2)-1 elements spread randomly accross n^2 cells (one empty cell)
2. Consider you are located at the empty cell; 4 moves are possible -
	(a) swap empty cell and Left cell
	(b) swap empty cell and Right cell
	(c) swap empty cell and top cell
	(d) swap empty cell and bottom cell
   After swapping, consider only those configurations of grid that are not formed previously (don't consider duplicate grids)
3. Repeat this process until -
	(a) you get the grid you wanted (or)
	(b) no other unique grid exists

BFS : Queue is used to store unique configurations of grid. Each configuration is dequeued in FIFO order to explore even more unique grids
DFS : Instead of Queue, stack is used i.e LIFO
