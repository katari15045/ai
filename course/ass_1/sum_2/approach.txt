BFS
---

1. Given a ramdom_grid, find the frequency of all the colors (1 to k) --- freq_lst
2. Make an empty grid, all 0s, n rows, n cols --- grid
3. Put grid[0][0] in the queue
4. while(queue is not empty)
	node = dequeue
	given a cell, put all "available colors (taken from freq_lst)" in the cell --- modified_grid
	update the freq_list according the color you've choosen in the prev step --- modified_freq_lst
	if(modified_grid is valid)
		put modified_grid, next_cell, modified_freq_lst - wrapped in an object, in the queue
	

DFS

Similar to BFS; instead of queue, use stack.
